Saltarello is a lively, fast-paced Italian dance that originated in the 14th century. [Vincenzo Galilei](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Galilei) was an Italian composer and lutenist who lived in the late 16th century and is credited with popularizing the saltarello in his music.

Galilei's Saltarello is a solo lute piece that was published in his "Fronimo" collection in 1568. The piece is written in tablature notation, which is a system of notation used for lute music that indicates which strings to pluck and where to place the fingers on the frets.

The piece has been popular among lutenists and guitarists for centuries, and has been transcribed for a variety of other instruments, including the harpsichord and the mandolin. It has also been used in film and television soundtracks, most notably in the 1992 film "The Lover."

Galilei's Saltarello is a prime example of Renaissance music, which is characterized by its use of modal harmonies, contrapuntal textures, and intricate rhythms. The piece is an important part of the lute repertoire and continues to be performed and studied by musicians today.
